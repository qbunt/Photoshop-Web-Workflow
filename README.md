There's currently just one simple Photoshop action. Hitting F13 (the default, which can be changed - see below), will take the currently selected layers (including Smart Objects) and will create a new file of the proper dimensions, copy the layers into it, and bring up the Save for Web dialog.

If you want to change the function key, you do that by clicking the menu dropdown on the Actions panel and select Action Options.

This action was created with Photoshop CS5, but should work with most recent versions.
